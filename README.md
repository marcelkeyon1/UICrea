# UICrea
Thanks Valik. Another question about autoit-gui. I tried compiling this script:  #include "GUI_include.au3"  GUICreate ( "onDemand", 200,200,800,200)  GUISetControl ( "button","Hello",10,10,185,20 )  GUIWaitClose ( )  but get an error message about GUICreate being an unknown function when I run the executable. Does compile work with autoit-gui?
